# Add multiple custom withdrawal to Dokan marketplace
This code shows how to create multiple additional custom withdrawal to Dokan marketplace

I needed to support withdrawals to sellers on Russian bank cards (MIR and TINKOFF), since the other payment systems that come with the kit do not work in Russia, I had to write additional code.
If anyone is interested, here is a link to the git hub with the sources, as well as a video of the code + how to add another one, or as many as you like
